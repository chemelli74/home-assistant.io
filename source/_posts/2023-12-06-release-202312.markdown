<!-- BELOW NEEDS TO BE REMOVED BEFORE THE RELEASE -->

These are the beta release notes for Home Assistant Core 2023.12 (and is thus a
work in progress).

If you encounter any issues with the beta release, please report them on GitHub:

- Issues with integrations, automations and such (Core related):<br>
  <https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues>
- Issues with the frontend/UI/dashboards:<br>
  <https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/issues>
- Issues with the documentation:<br>
  <https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.io/issues>

Please be sure to include the beta version you are running in the issue
version field (not title), so we can classify your issue correctly.

Issues introduced in the beta are processed with priority.

### If you are using Matter with this beta release <!-- omit in toc -->

We now have a beta flag/option on the main (stable) version of the add-on.
Toggle that to transform the add-on to the "beta channel". If you are
participating in the beta, enabling this option is strongly recommended.
